#
# Tests for deploy/caddy/check-cert.sh.
#
# check-cert.sh shipped with shellcheck and no execution, which is the same
# mistake deploy/check-host.test.sh exists to prevent one level down: a checker
# whose green output is trusted, and which nobody has ever watched fail. It is
# run once a week by cron on a box where the consequence of a wrong answer is a
# silent certificate expiry, so "it looked right" is not enough.
#
# check-cert.sh needs no test seams. It resolves docker, openssl and date
# through PATH, so a fixture directory in front of PATH is the whole harness.
# `date` is deliberately NOT stubbed: the arithmetic under test is real date
# arithmetic, and the fixtures generate expiry timestamps relative to now.
#
# Run:  sh deploy/caddy/check-cert.test.sh
# Exit: 0 all assertions passed, 1 otherwise.

# The stub bodies below are single-quoted on purpose: they are shell source
# written to a file and run later, so $1/$@ must reach the stub unexpanded.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
