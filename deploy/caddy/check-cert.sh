#
# Catches the two ways TLS on tugpt.app can fail without anyone noticing until
# the site goes down.
#
# 1. The Caddy container cannot resolve DNS.
#
#    Docker copies the host's /etc/resolv.conf into containers. On a host
#    running systemd-resolved that file can contain only 127.0.0.53 — the stub
#    listener, which exists only in the host's network namespace and is
#    unreachable from inside a container. Docker usually detects the stub and
#    substitutes public resolvers, but not always, and when it does not the
#    container has no working DNS at all.
#
#    This bit us on the 2026-08-24 deployment: the initial ACME challenge
#    failed for exactly this reason. The compose file now pins explicit
#    resolvers on the caddy service so the container does not depend on the
#    host's resolv.conf. This check exists because that is a setting somebody
#    can remove, and because the consequence is invisible: an existing
#    certificate keeps serving for weeks while every renewal attempt fails.
#
# 2. The served certificate is close to expiring.
#
#    Caddy renews at roughly two-thirds of the lifetime — around 30 days out on
#    a 90-day Let's Encrypt certificate. If renewals are failing, the remaining
#    days tick down silently. Anything under three weeks means renewal has been
#    failing for a week or more and needs looking at now, not at expiry.
#
# Usage, on the VPS:
#
#   cd /opt/tugpt
#   set -a; . /etc/tugpt/web.env; set +a
#   sh deploy/caddy/check-cert.sh
#
# Invoked as `sh <path>` rather than `./<path>` on purpose: this file arrives
# through the GitHub API, which writes blobs as 0644, so the executable bit
# does not survive a fresh clone. `chmod +x` it if you prefer, but nothing
# here depends on that.
#
# Exit codes: 0 all good, 1 a check failed, 2 it could not run.
#
# Optional, as root, to be told rather than to remember:
#
#   0 7 * * 1 cd /opt/tugpt && set -a && . /etc/tugpt/web.env && set +a && \
#     sh deploy/caddy/check-cert.sh || \
#     logger -t tugpt-cert -p daemon.err "TLS check failed on tugpt.app"
#
# Weekly is the right cadence: it gives roughly four warnings between the first
# failed renewal and an outage.
