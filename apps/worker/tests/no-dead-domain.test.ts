/**
 * `tugpt.ai` is hostile. This keeps it from coming back.
 *
 * WHY A TEST AND NOT A CODE REVIEW
 *
 * On 2026-08-28 control of `tugpt.ai` was lost and `tugpt.app` became canonical.
 * The migration audit was done by hand, with grep, and grep missed two entire
 * categories on the first pass:
 *
 *   - `deploy/caddy/check-cert.test.sh` asserts on output with escaped regex —
 *     the file contains `tugpt\.ai`, so a literal search for `tugpt.ai` scored
 *     four fewer hits than there were.
 *   - `supabase/config.toml` carried `project_id = "tugpt-ai"`, spelled with a
 *     hyphen, which no search for the dotted form would ever surface.
 *
 * Both were found only because the fixtures went red and a second, looser sweep
 * was run. A one-time audit that needs two tries is not a control. This is.
 *
 * SCOPE: runtime and deployment paths only.
 *
 * Prose is deliberately out of scope. `docs/` and `docs/adr/` have to be able to
 * describe the incident, name the domain that was lost, and keep decision
 * records that were true when written — a guard that forbade the string there
 * would make the incident undocumentable, which is worse than the risk it
 * removes. What is guarded is everything that runs or deploys: application and
 * package source, deploy scripts, compose, systemd units, Supabase config.
