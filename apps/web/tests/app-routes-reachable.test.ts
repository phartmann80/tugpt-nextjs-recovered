/**
 * @file app-routes-reachable.test.ts
 * @description "Every page reachable without typing a URL" — the Sep 11
 * milestone's own wording, turned into something that fails.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Until 2026-08-31 the app had no navigation at all. `/dashboard/drafts`
 * rendered a bare heading; `/auth/logout` existed, worked, and could be
 * reached only by typing it into the address bar. Nothing was broken in a way
 * any test could see, because "there is no way to get here" is not a defect
 * any *page* has — it is a defect in the space between pages, which is exactly
 * the kind nobody notices until a reviewer asks how to sign out.
 *
 * `proxy-route-coverage.test.ts` already asks whether every route is
 * *classified* on purpose. This asks the other half: whether every route can
 * be *arrived at* on purpose. A page can be perfectly authenticated and still
 * be unreachable, and under deny-by-default an unreachable page is the
 * likelier failure of the two.
 *
 * HOW IT DECIDES
 *
 * A page is reachable if the primary navigation links to it, or if REACHED_BY
 * below names the thing that does. The second list is not an escape hatch: a
 * dynamic route has no fixed URL to put in a nav, and a login page is arrived
 * at by being bounced there. Each entry has to say what links to it, and a
 * reason too short to name anything fails T4 — the same rule
 * `proxy-route-coverage.test.ts` applies to its `why` strings, and for the
 * same reason. "n/a" is how a table like this stops meaning anything.
 *
 * API routes are out of scope. They are called by code, not navigated to.
