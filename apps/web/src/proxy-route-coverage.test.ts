/**
 * classifyRoute() in proxy.ts used to be an allowlist of protected prefixes
 * with a public fallback:
 *
 *   if (/auth ...)        -> 'auth'
 *   if (/dashboard | /settings | /crm | /organizations) -> 'protected'
 *   return 'public'
 *
 * That failed open. A page added at a path nobody remembered to add to the
 * protected list was served by the proxy with no authentication check at all,
 * and nothing about writing that page would reveal it — the failure was
 * silence.
 *
 * As of 2026-08-24 it is inverted: anything not explicitly listed as `auth` or
 * `public` is `protected`. This file was written first, because inverting the
 * default is only safe once the full public surface is enumerated and each
 * entry has a recorded reason — and that is what the table below is.
 *
 * Both halves still earn their place, and they catch opposite mistakes:
 *
 *   - Deny-by-default stops an unlisted route from being *exposed*.
 *   - This table stops a route from being classified *silently*, either way.
 *     Under deny-by-default a forgotten route is unreachable rather than
 *     leaked, and unreachable is also a bug — one that now fails here rather
 *     than in production.
 *
 * The route table must match the app directory exactly, so a new route fails
 * the suite until somebody classifies it on purpose and records why. The last
 * test is the one with teeth: it fails the moment a page outside /auth becomes
 * reachable without an authentication check.
