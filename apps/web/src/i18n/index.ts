/**
 * The i18n mechanism. Two locales, two flat dictionaries, no library.
 *
 * next-intl and i18next both solve problems this product does not have —
 * locale-segmented routing, lazy namespace loading, plural rule engines for
 * languages with more than two forms. What they cost is a routing convention
 * and a runtime that every future UI PR has to be written against. ADR-017 has
 * the full reasoning; the short version is that the whole mechanism is this
 * file plus `provider.tsx`, and that is the right size for es + en.
 *
 * Server components call `getDictionary` / `createTranslator` directly. Client
 * components call `useT()` from `./provider`.
