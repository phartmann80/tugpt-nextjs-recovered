/**
 * @file ConversationThread.tsx
 * @description The customer's history, beside the draft. The Sep 18 milestone.
 *
 * WHAT A REVIEWER IS DOING HERE
 *
 * Approving a reply on behalf of a business, to a person the business knows and
 * they do not. Before this existed, the screen showed one message — the one the
 * draft answers — with no way to tell whether the customer had already asked
 * the same thing twice, whether the shop had answered an hour ago, or whether
 * the draft repeats something already said. The reviewer had the AI's guess and
 * no context to judge it against, which is the wrong side of a
 * human-in-the-loop product to be short of information on.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS SAYS OUT LOUD RATHER THAN HIDING
 *
 *   * Older messages exist but are not shown. A thread that silently stops is
 *     one a reviewer reads as complete.
 *   * The message being answered is not in the window. Rare, and invisible
 *     unless stated — the reviewer would read a history that does not contain
 *     the message the draft is replying to.
 *
 * THE HANDOFF CONTROL LIVES HERE, NOT ON THE INBOX
 *
 * Deciding that a conversation needs a person is a decision made while reading
 * it, not while scanning a list. And it is not a label: `process_inbound_message`
 * enqueues a draft only for conversations whose status is `open`, so handing
 * off **stops the AI drafting replies to this customer** until someone returns
 * it. The button says so, and the screen says so while it is off.
 *
 * NO SEND CONTROL, HERE LEAST OF ALL. This is the screen that most looks like a
 * chat, which is exactly why Amendment 7 is asserted against it by name in
 * `ConversationThread.test.tsx`. Nothing in TuGPT sends.
