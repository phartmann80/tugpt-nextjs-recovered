 * page added without a way to get to it should fail a test rather than wait
 * for somebody to notice they cannot find it.
 *
 * The thread view (Sep 18) added no entry — it lives inside a draft. The
 * unified inbox (Sep 25) is here, and first: it answers "who is waiting",
 * which is the question a reviewer arrives with, while the draft list answers
 * "what did the AI write" about the subset that already has a draft.
