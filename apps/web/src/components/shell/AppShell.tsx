/**
 * The frame every dashboard page renders inside.
 *
 * A server component. Only `PrimaryNav` is a client component, because only
 * the active-item highlight needs the current path — the organization name and
 * the reviewer's email are read on the server and rendered there.
 *
 * WHY THE ORGANIZATION NAME IS IN THE HEADER
 *
 * TuGPT is multi-tenant and the drafts on screen are replies that will be sent
 * as a business, to that business's customers. A reviewer who cannot see whose
 * inbox they are approving from is one org-switch away from sending a bakery's
 * prices to a hardware store's customer. It is not decoration.
