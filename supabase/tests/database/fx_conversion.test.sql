-- fx_conversion.test.sql
--
-- EUR->USD accounting (migration 20260903000006). Paul's decision, 2026-09-03:
-- ECB daily euro reference rate, entered manually, monthly cadence acceptable,
-- and a stale rate WARNS but does not BLOCK.
--
-- THE RATE IN FORCE IS THE LATEST ONE AT OR BEFORE THE INSTANT (R1-R6). Not
-- "the newest row" -- R3 requires that a rate published after an event is not
-- reached backwards for, because valuing last quarter at today's rate is
-- inventing history, and R4's positive control requires that the newest
-- eligible rate does win.
--
-- IDENTITY NEEDS NO ROW (R1, R6). A database with an empty fx_rates table must
-- still account USD spend in USD. Returning NULL there would make the meter
-- refuse every organization on the day this shipped.
--
-- THE CONVERSION IS STORED, NOT RECOMPUTED (C1, C6). The rate and its date go
-- on the row. C6 moves the rate afterwards and requires the recorded figure
-- not to follow -- without which last month's total silently changes every
-- time somebody enters a new rate.
--
-- AN EVENT ALREADY IN THE ACCOUNTING CURRENCY STORES NO RATE (C2). A stored
-- 1.0 would record a conversion that never happened. The CHECKs encode that
-- asymmetry deliberately: a rate implies a converted amount, but not the
-- reverse.
--
-- STALE WARNS, NEVER BLOCKS (S1-S4). S3 is the one that matters: a rate well
-- past the threshold must still convert and the meter must still answer.
