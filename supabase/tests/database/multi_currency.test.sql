-- multi_currency.test.sql
--
-- Two currencies in the price book (migration 20260903000005): Langdock bills
-- EUR, Gladia bills USD.
--
-- 20260903000002 restricted every currency column to 'USD' and said the check
-- existed so that "the day a EUR-billing provider arrives, the constraint
-- fails loudly and someone makes a decision, instead of the totals quietly
-- becoming meaningless." This file is that decision, asserted.
--
-- THE CURRENCY IS DERIVED, NEVER DEFAULTED (C1-C6). `record_provider_usage`
-- did not set `currency` at all — it took the column default, which was 'USD'.
-- Harmless while USD was the only currency; the moment EUR rates exist it
-- stamps every Langdock event USD while its components carry EUR prices, which
-- passes every constraint and produces a total wrong by the exchange rate.
-- C1 is the assertion that would have caught it, and it is the reason this
-- migration is not simply eight INSERTs.
--
-- ONE EVENT, ONE CURRENCY (M1). An event's components are summed into its
-- total, so they must share a currency for that total to mean anything.
--
-- THE METER REFUSES RATHER THAN UNDER-REPORTS (T1-T4). Skipping foreign-
-- currency rows returns a number that is too small, which for an enforcement
-- meter means letting an organization past a cap it has already exceeded — and
-- it looks like it works, which is what makes it worse than raising. T3 is the
-- one that matters: a period holding both currencies must not quietly report
-- the USD half.
--
-- THE RATES ARE THE RATES (P1-P5). P2 asserts the per-1M figures a human
-- actually read off the vendor's page, recovered from what is stored, rather
-- than asserting the stored literal against itself.
