-- transcription_worker_rpcs.test.sql
--
-- The five queue verbs the transcription worker runs on (migration
-- 20260905000001): claim, retry, succeed, skip, dead-letter.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS DEFENDING, in descending order of cost:
--
--   1. Paying twice for one voice note. Gladia bills on submission, so every
--      path that could hand the same job to a provider a second time is an
--      invoice. Three of them exist and each is tested against a positive
--      control: the fourth delivery (R8/R9), a redelivered message for a job
--      that already completed (R10), and a lease too short for a legitimate
--      wait (R2 pins the 120s default that exists for exactly that reason).
--
--   2. A delivery count that is not the queue's. `attempts` lives in two
--      places -- the job row and PGMQ's read_ct -- and read_ct is
--      authoritative. R4-R7 pin the reconciliation in both directions,
--      including the refusal to accept a decrease, and A-group asserts the
--      archive records what was measured rather than coercing a legal value.
--
--   3. Codes the RPC will not accept. On 2026-08-19 the draft worker produced
--      eight terminal codes and its archive RPC accepted five; every terminal
--      failure became three phantom retries and the provider's real complaint
--      was recorded nowhere. A4 and A11 make that impossible to reintroduce
--      quietly here: the allowlist is asserted to accept every code the
--      worker can produce, one assertion per code, not as a set.
--
-- ON THE FIXTURE TRAP. Four times in this stack a test has passed while
-- testing nothing, because its fixture stopped satisfying a precondition the
-- assertion could not see. Two defences are used throughout: every "returns
-- nothing" is paired with a control proving the same fixture DOES return
-- something one step earlier, and every assertion expecting a constraint to
-- fire names the row it fires on.
--
-- ON WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. W4 asserts there is NO
-- public.fail_transcription_job. That is not an oversight being documented --
-- it is the decision recorded in the migration header (the function's attempts
-- increment predates the claim RPC and would double-count against read_ct), and
-- an absence nobody tests is an absence that returns.
