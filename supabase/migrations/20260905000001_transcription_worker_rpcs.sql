-- ===========================================================================
-- The RPCs the transcription worker needs to exist at all.
--
-- Migration: 20260905000001_transcription_worker_rpcs.sql
--
-- 20260903000008 built the transcript ingest path and said what it was not
-- building: "NO CONSUMER SHIPS HERE. The queue and the completion RPCs land
-- with nothing reading them." This is the consumer's half of that, and it is
-- a migration rather than worker code because of where the boundary sits:
--
--   * `complete_transcription_job` and `fail_transcription_job` live in the
--     `private` schema. PostgREST exposes only the API schemas, so the worker
--     cannot reach them at all today.
--
--   * Claiming work from PGMQ has to reconcile the queue's delivery count
--     against the job row under a lock. Done from the worker that is two round
--     trips with a window in between.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. SHAPED LIKE THE DRAFT PATH, ON PURPOSE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The draft queue RPCs (20260805000015, 20260805000018, 20260819000001)
-- already solved this problem, and the transcription queue has the same
-- failure modes. So this ships the same five verbs with the same contracts:
--
--     read_transcription_jobs        claim, reconciling attempts to read_ct
--     set_transcription_visibility   transient retry backoff
--     delete_transcription_job       success
--     archive_transcription_failed_job  terminal: dead-letter + failed_jobs
--     skip_transcription_job         not-a-failure termination
--
-- Plus one the draft path has no equivalent of, because draft generation is
-- synchronous and this is not:
--
--     record_transcription_submission  persist the provider's job id before
--                                      waiting, so a timeout is resumable
--                                      rather than payable twice
--
-- Mirroring rather than inventing is the whole point: the dead-letter runbook,
-- the operational queries and the worker tests all speak that vocabulary
-- already. Where this diverges from draft it is written down, at the divergence.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. WHY private.fail_transcription_job IS NOT WIRED UP HERE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- 20260903000008 shipped `private.fail_transcription_job`, which increments
-- `attempts` and puts the job back to 'queued'. It was written before any
-- claim RPC existed, when the job row was the only place a delivery could be
-- counted.
--
-- It is now the second place. `read_transcription_jobs` reconciles `attempts`
-- to PGMQ's `read_ct`, which is authoritative, and a worker calling both would
-- count every delivery twice: the third failure would archive with attempts=4
-- for three provider calls. So the worker does what the draft worker does --
-- `set_transcription_visibility` for a transient retry, `archive` for a
-- terminal one -- and never calls it.
--
-- It is left in place and untouched (its tests still hold) rather than dropped,
-- because dropping a shipped function is a bigger change than not calling it,
-- and it remains correct for a caller that does not also claim through PGMQ.
-- There is deliberately NO public wrapper for it: an RPC the worker must not
-- call should not be reachable from the worker's client.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. WHY DEAD LETTERS GO TO failed_jobs
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- `transcription_jobs` already records `status = 'dead_lettered'` and an
-- error code, so this is not the only place the information exists. It is,
-- however, the place the dead-letter runbook looks -- `failed_jobs` is already
-- the union of the Phase 3A ingest vocabulary and the Phase 3B draft one,
-- grouped by comment. Adding a third group is how that table has grown twice
-- before; leaving transcription out would mean one job family whose failures
-- are invisible to the tooling built for the other two.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4. ERROR CODES ADDED HERE (P3I family, continuing 20260903000008)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   P3I03  TRANSCRIPTION_JOB_IDENTITY_MISMATCH  (mirrors P3B08)
--   P3I04  INVALID_TRANSCRIPTION_ATTEMPTS       (mirrors P3B16)
--   P3I05  TRANSCRIPTION_ARCHIVE_STATE_ERROR    (mirrors P3B12)
--   P3I06  INVALID_TRANSCRIPTION_FAILURE_CODE   (mirrors P3B15)
--   P3I07  INVALID_TRANSCRIPTION_SUBMISSION     (empty provider job reference)
--   P3I08  TRANSCRIPTION_SUBMISSION_ALREADY_RECORDED
--
-- P3I05 is distinct from P3I02 (already terminal) on purpose: the worker
-- reacts to it by deleting a stale queue message, exactly as the draft worker
-- reacts to P3B12, and it must be able to tell that case from a generic
-- failure.
