/**
 * @file prompt-builder.ts
 * @description Builds ChatMessage[] from source message text and ai_draft_config fields.
 *
 * Constructs a system message from business_instructions, personality,
 * response_rules and tone, followed by a guardrail block that no per-organization
 * configuration can remove.
 *
 * maxDraftLength is an output-length constraint measured in characters against
 * the final draft text. It is NOT passed as maxTokens (which is a token limit).
 * A separate conservative provider-token limit may be used by the orchestrator.
 *
 * 2026-08-30 — TWO CHANGES, BOTH FROM THE SUPERVISED FLIP.
 *
 * The evidence from that flip is the reason this file changed rather than only
 * the seeded defaults. Run against the unconstrained configuration, the model
 * invented opening hours and a $300–$800 price range for a bakery that had told
 * it neither. Run against a configuration carrying anti-invention rules, the
 * same questions produced grounded refusals and a request for contact details.
 * The difference was entirely in the config text — which is to say it was
 * optional, editable, and one careless edit away from being gone.
 *
 *   1. The guardrail is emitted here, for every draft, and is appended LAST so
 *      that nothing in the per-organization text sits after it. An organization
 *      can shape its own voice; it cannot switch off the rule that stops the
 *      model inventing prices to a customer.
 *
 *   2. The scaffolding is Spanish. It was English — "Business Instructions:",
 *      "Keep your response under N characters" — wrapped around Spanish
 *      business instructions, which is a mixed-language prompt and a nudge
 *      toward English replies in a product whose customers write Spanish. The
 *      reply language is not decided by this scaffolding either way: the
 *      guardrail states explicitly that the draft follows the language the
 *      customer wrote in, which is what an Ecuadorian shop with the occasional
 *      English-speaking tourist actually needs (ADR-015 records the same point:
 *      the customer's language is not the operator's).
 *
 * 2026-08-31 — the scaffolding follows `organizations.locale`.
 *
 * Hardcoding Spanish was right while one organization existed and it was
 * Spanish. It is the same mixed-language defect mirrored the moment a second
 * one has `locale = 'en'`: English business instructions inside Spanish
 * headings, under a Spanish block of non-negotiable rules. The words now live
 * in `prompt-scaffolding.ts`, keyed by locale, and an unknown locale falls back
 * to Spanish rather than failing a draft. See that file for why the rules are
 * a keyed record rather than a list.

/**
 * The rules that hold for every organization, in every draft.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. This is not a place to encode product opinions about
 * how a business should talk to its customers — that is what
 * `ai_draft_configs` is for. Every line here exists because getting it wrong
 * produces a message a business would have to retract:
 *
 *   * inventing a price, an opening hour or an availability is a promise the
 *     business did not make, and the reviewer approving the draft may not know
 *     the number is fabricated;
 *   * a draft that cannot answer is far more useful as a captured lead than as
 *     a plausible guess;
 *   * claiming to be a person when asked directly is a lie the business would
 *     be making, not the model.
 *
 * On that last rule: nothing here tells the model to announce itself
 * unprompted. Every draft is read and approved by a person before it is sent,
 * so the message is the business's own words. But a *mandatory* instruction to
 * conceal how it was written is not something to bake into every organization's
 * prompt, so the rule is honesty when asked rather than disclosure by default.
