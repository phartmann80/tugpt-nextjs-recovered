/**
 * @file prompt-scaffolding.ts
 * @description The prompt's own words, per locale — labels and the
 * non-negotiable rules.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Until 2026-08-31 `prompt-builder.ts` wrote Spanish scaffolding around every
 * draft, for every organization. That was the right fix on 2026-08-30, when
 * English labels were being wrapped around Spanish business instructions and
 * the file's own header called the result "a mixed-language prompt and a nudge
 * toward English replies in a product whose customers write Spanish."
 *
 * It is the same defect mirrored the moment a second organization exists with
 * `organizations.locale = 'en'`. That organization writes its instructions in
 * English, and the model receives them inside Spanish headings under a Spanish
 * block of non-negotiable rules. Nobody notices, because the guardrail already
 * tells the model to reply in the customer's language, so the *output* looks
 * fine — and a prompt that is subtly harder for the model to follow is not a
 * failure anything reports.
 *
 * There is exactly one organization today, and it is Spanish. This costs
 * nothing now and stops being free the day a second one is created, which is
 * the whole argument for doing it before rather than after.
 *
 * WHY THE RULES ARE KEYED, NOT LISTED
 *
 * `Record<PromptLocale, Record<GuardrailRule, string>>` means a locale that is
 * missing a rule does not compile. That matters more here than anywhere else
 * in the codebase: the rules are what stop a model inventing a price to a
 * customer, and an English organization silently missing the anti-invention
 * line would be invisible until it invented one.
 *
 * What the type cannot see — an empty string, a translation that lost its
 * `{max}` placeholder, an "English" line still in Spanish because someone
 * copy-pasted the block and stopped — is what `tests/prompt-scaffolding.test.ts`
 * is for.
 */

/**
 * One rule per line of the non-negotiable block.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, and unchanged from the 2026-08-30 set. This is not a
 * place to encode product opinions about how a business should talk to its
 * customers — that is what `ai_draft_configs` is for. Every rule here exists
 * because getting it wrong produces a message a business would have to retract.
